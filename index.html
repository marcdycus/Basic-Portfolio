            <p>
            I grew up in a small town in central Arkansas. That's where most of my family 
            still lives, and always has lived for as long as, even my grandparents, know. I moved to Kansas City, Missouri 
            for my art degree when I graduated high school, and after saving up
            some money, I moved to New York.
            </p>

            <p>
            I have a 50 pound goldendoodle named Nora and two cats named Florence and Olive. 
            They are my fur children, and they're also Arkansans.
            </p>
        
            <p>
            I've been bartending ever since I moved to New York, and I've been 
            teaching myself how to code on the side as much as I have time. I hope to soon transition
            to a career path that allows me to enhance what knowledge I have and will have.
